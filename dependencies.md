# Dependencies

## Engines

### node@10.13

[prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/blob/master/package.json)

## Rationale

### yarn@1

ESLint does not support Plug'n'Play's stricter dependency resolution.

The [`node_modules` plugin](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/tree/master/packages/plugin-node-modules) has known issues that block usage.

## Watchlist

### Dependabot

Dependabot has been acquired by [GitHub](https://dependabot.com/blog/hello-github/) with plans to integrate it.
When it is integrated, the [Depandabot Preview](https://github.com/marketplace/dependabot-preview) application can be removed from the repository.

### node@14

#### ETA

- 2020-04-21 release

### npm@7

Keep an eye on npm.
Acquisition by [GitHub](https://github.blog/2020-03-16-npm-is-joining-github/) and fragmentation in yarn community could turn the tide.
