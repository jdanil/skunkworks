### Watchlist

Upcoming versions of dependencies.

#### bundlesize

The author is working on v2 in another [bundlesize2](https://github.com/siddharthkp/bundlesize2) repository.
Other alternatives have also emerged such as [bundlewatch](https://github.com/bundlewatch/bundlewatch) which looks to be more actively maintained, but is less popular.
