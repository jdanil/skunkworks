# Package

## Dependencies

### Rationale

Justification for using pinned, outdated, or pre-release versions of dependencies.

#### webpack@5-beta

Persistent cache improves cold start time.

### Watchlist

Upcoming versions of dependencies.

#### @compiled/css-in-js

#### bundlesize

[bundlesize](https://github.com/siddharthkp/bundlesize) has not been actively maintained.
The author is working on v2 in another [bundlesize2](https://github.com/siddharthkp/bundlesize2) repository.
Other alternatives have also emerged such as [bundlewatch](https://github.com/bundlewatch/bundlewatch) which looks to be more actively maintained, but is less popular.
