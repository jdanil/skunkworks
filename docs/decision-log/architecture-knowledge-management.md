# Architecture Knowledge Management

## Context

Architectural decisions are design decisions that address architecturally-significant requirements.

### Glossary

- **Architecture Knowledge Management (AKM)**: the efficient handling of information and resources pertaining to software architecture.
- **Architecture Decision Log (ADL)**: a collection of architecture decision records created and maintained for a particular project.
- **Architecture Decision Record (ADR)**: a document that captures an important architectural decision.
- **Architecture Decision (AD)**: a software design choice that addresses a significant requirement.
- **Architecturally-Significant Requirement (ASR)**: a requirement that has a measurable effect on a software system's architecture and quality.

## Decision

Record architectural decisions in a decision log in this repository.

A [decision backlog](index.md) will be maintained for less pertinent decisions.

## Rationale

Recording architectural decisions provides context to future contributors, facilitates transparency, and allows for external oversight.

Storing architectural decisions in source control helps keep records in sync with the code and archives historical changes.

ThoughtWorks recommends adoption of [lightweight architecture decision records](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/lightweight-architecture-decision-records) in their technology radar.
